# To-Do List Application Using React and Material UI

With this application, one can add tasks or any personal notes and delete all of them at once.
This application doesn't have the ability to store data permanently. So all the tasks saved will get removed once the site is reloaded.

This application is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed using the following link - https://souvik-pl.github.io/react-ToDoList-App/
